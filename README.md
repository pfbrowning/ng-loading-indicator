## Peer Dependencies
* [@browninglogic/ng-modal](https://github.com/pfbrowning/ng-modal) (^4.0.0)
* [@angular/common](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/common) (^8.0.0 or ^9.0.0)
* [@angular/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/core) (^8.0.0 or ^9.0.0)

The library has been tested with Angular 8 and 9.

## Upgrade Notes
* As of version 3.0.0, Angular 8 is required.  For support for Angular 6 & 7, please refer to version 2.0.4.
* As of version 2.0.0 of the loading indicator, version 4.0.0 of 
[@browninglogic/ng-modal](https://github.com/pfbrowning/ng-modal) is now required.
In addition, I've renamed my CSS classes from camelCase to hyphen-case
for readability and added prefixes for specificity.  As a result, if you were 
previously referencing the loadingMessage class in your CSS, you'll want to 
rename those references to nli-loading-message accordingly.  Version 4.0.0
of @browninglogic/ng-modal includes similar CSS changes, so if you were referencing
any of its CSS classes you'll want to check those 
[upgrade notes](https://github.com/pfbrowning/ng-modal) as well.

## Installation
ng-loading-indicator depends on [@browninglogic/ng-modal](https://github.com/pfbrowning/ng-modal).  Install them both:
```bash
$ npm i @browninglogic/ng-loading-indicator @browninglogic/ng-modal --save
```
Then import NgLoadingIndicatorModule and ModalManagerModule
```typescript
import { NgLoadingIndicatorModule } from '@browninglogic/ng-loading-indicator';
import { ModalManagerModule } from '@browninglogic/ng-modal';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    ModalManagerModule,
    NgLoadingIndicatorModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```
## Usage
Place a single `<nli-loading-indicator></nli-loading-indicator>` within the template of your application's root component (app.component.html by Angular CLI convention).  This is a global loading indicator which will show and hide itself accordingly when you tell it to using the LoadingIndicatorService from anywhere within the application.
```html
<nli-loading-indicator></nli-loading-indicator>
```
Inject the LoadingIndicatorService into any component that you want to show the loading indicator from.  When you want to show the loading indicator, call `showLoadingIndicator()` on the injected service, optionally passing custom text to show as the header.  If you don't provide loading text, the indicator will be shown with a default header of "Loading".  When you want to hide the loading indicator, simply call `hideLoadingIndicator` on the injected service.
```typescript
constructor(private loadingIndicatorService : LoadingIndicatorService) {}

public show(): void {
    // Show the loading indicator
    this.loadingIndicatorService.showLoadingIndicator();
    // Simulate a two second API call
    timer(2000)
      /* Hide the loading indicator after the completion of the API call. */
      .pipe(finalize(() => this.loadingIndicatorService.hideLoadingIndicator()))
      .subscribe();
}
```
Take note of the fact that we're hiding the loading indicator within finalize, rather than within subscribe: we want to close the loading indicator regardless of whether the operation completed successfully or errored out.

You can change the loading text in the middle of a long-running operation by calling showLoadingIndicator with different messages throughout your long-running operation before finally calling hideLoadingIndicator upon completion.  This could be useful if you're performing a complicated Observable sequence involving multiple sequential API calls and you want to inform your user of what's happening throughout the process.
```typescript

public showDifferentMessages(): void {
    // Show the loading indicator with custom loading message text
    this.loadingIndicatorService.showLoadingIndicator("Fetching the first thing");
    // Simulate a two second API call
    timer(2000).pipe(
      // Change the loading message text between the first and second simulated API call
      tap(() => this.loadingIndicatorService.showLoadingIndicator("Fetching something else")),
      // Simulate a second two second API call
      switchMap(() => timer(2000)),
      /* Hide the loading indicator upon completion of both of the simulated API 
      calls, regardless of whether the operation succeeded or failed. */
      finalize(() => this.loadingIndicatorService.hideLoadingIndicator())
    ).subscribe();
}
```
## Styling
[@browninglogic/ng-loading-indicator](https://github.com/pfbrowning/ng-loading-indicator) uses [@browninglogic/ng-modal](https://github.com/pfbrowning/ng-modal) and, as such, styling works in the same way for both components.  The component provides four input properties which allow you to supply your own CSS classes:
* *modalClass* - class to apply to the modal window of the underlying @browninglogic/ng-modal.  This is a simple passthrough.
* *overlayClass* - class to apply to the overlay of the underlying @browninglogic/ng-modal.  This is a simple passthrough.
* *loadingMessageClass* - class to apply to the loading message header.  For example, if you want to adjust the font or header, this would be the place to do it.
* *spinnerClass* - class to apply to the CSS spinner.  For example, if you wanted to change the size, color, or speed of the spinner, this would be the place to do it.
### Example Template
```html
<nli-loading-indicator modalClass="custom-modal" overlayClass="custom-overlay" loadingMessageClass="custom-loading-message" spinnerClass="custom-spinner"></nli-loading-indicator>
```
### Example Global Styles
```css
/* In order to set basic styles that aren't already applied by
the library, simply define your custom styles in a CSS class and
then bind that class name to the corresponding input property */
.custom-loading-message {
    font-style:italic;
}
/* Use a more specific CSS selector in order to 
override styles which are already applied by the
library, such as changing the color of the spinner*/
div.spinner.custom-spinner {
    border-top-color:green;
}
/* Override the loading message header margin */
h1.nli-loading-message.custom-loading-message {
    margin:15px;
}
/* Override the border color of the loading indicator modal */
div.nm-modal-window.custom-modal {
    border-color: black;
}
/* Override the modal overlay with a higher opacity */
div.nm-modal-window.custom-overlay {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
}
```
